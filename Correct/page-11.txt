a. Detailed Description of the Manuscripts. 

M 1. — This is a neatly- written manuscript in Devanāgāri characters on 
paper. It originally consisted of 13 leaves, but the first two are missing. 
The accent has been marked in yellow ink. The text is not bounded on 
either side by double lines. 

The size of the paper is 911/5'' x 3 3/4|". 

The number of lines on each page varies from 9 to 10. The date given 
on f. 14 r. as śak. 1455, is not reliable, and has obviously been added at 
a later period by a different hand, as the evidence of the writing indicates. 
The manuscript is well preserved, but neither its general appearance nor 
the condition and the colour of its paper, nor its spelling lend the least 
support to the date given above. It is on the whole accurate. It belongs 
to the longer recension. The scribe seems to have been a devotee of Krsna, 
for he says : …………………………. Neither the name of the scribe, nor of the 
owner, nor of the place of its origin, is known. 

M 2. — This is perhaps the oldest of all the manuscripts of the Nighantu. 
It is written in Devanāgāri characters on paper, but is not well preserved. 
In many places it suffers from illegibility, partly caused by the smudging 
of the ink. 

It begins : ……………………………………………………………………… . • , &c. It gives 
the śiksā Catustaya in 26 leaves. The different treatises are not bodily
